# AdventOfCode 2022

Elixir again! Same runner, slightly modified to use [Streams](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html) instead.

## Solving Puzzles

For a given day:

1. `mix start [day_num]`
2. Implement `part1` and `part2` using the `input/0` function, returning the
   answer as a string.
3. Run `mix solve [day_num]` to print the answer for both parts.
