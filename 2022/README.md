# AdventOfCode 2022

Elixir again! Same runner, slightly modified to use [Streams](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html) instead.

## Solving Puzzles

For a given day:

1. `mix advent.fetch_input [year].[day_num]`
2. `mix advent.gen.day [day_num]`
3. Implement `part1` and `part2` using the `input/0` function, returning the
   answer as a string.
4. Run `mix advent.solve [day_num]` to print the answer for both parts.
