# AdventOfCode 2024

I [tried using Gleam](./2024_gleam/) but bounced off. Maybe next time. Back to Elixir!

## Solving Puzzles

For a given day:

1. `mix start [day_num]`
2. Implement `part1` and `part2` using the `input/0` function, returning the
   answer as a string.
3. Run `mix solve [day_num]` to print the answer for both parts.
